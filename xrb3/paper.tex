\section{Introduction}\label{Sec:Introduction}

X-ray bursts (XRBs) result from thermonuclear burning of an accreted
H/He or He layer on a neutron star \citep{galloway:2017}.
Observations of brightness oscillations in the rise of the lightcurve
suggest that the burning begins localized and then spreads across the
neutron star.  This spreading is inherently a multi-dimensional
phenomena, and hydrodynamic simulations that resolve the reactive zone
and capture the scales over which rotation is important are needed to
understand the flame propagation.  We show a first attempt at modeling
the full three-dimensional ignition and spreading of a hot spot in an
XRB.  This builds on our earlier two dimensional work
\citep{eiden:2020,harpole:2021} that developed our simulation
framework and explored how the acceleration of the burning front
depends on the initial model structure.  As with those simulations, we
use the freely-available \castro\ simulation code
\citep{castro,castro_joss} simulation code.


To understand how the burning front propagates across the surface, we
need to do multidimensional simulations.  The work of
\citet{cavecchi:2013,art-2015-cavecchi-etal,art-2016-cavecchi-etal}

The three-dimensional study by \citet{Cavecchi2019} showed...

The goal of this paper is to understand the challenges of a fully-resolved
three-dimensional simulation and explore what is possible.  This will inform
our follow-on simulations.

\section{Simulations and Results}\label{Sec:results}

In \citet{harpole:2021}, we explored several different rotation rates
and initial model thermal structures.  We explored several different
temperature structures in our initial model.  We choose a model with a
neutron star crust temperature of $2\times 10^8~\mathrm{K}$.  We adopt
this model for the 3D simulation presented here, since it gives a clean
well-defined flame.

Moving to 3D is very expensive, so to further reduce the computational
expense, we use an aniostropic resolution, with 32 cm laterally and 16 cm resolution
vertically.  This is finer vertically than done in 
\citet{harpole:2021}.  We pick a rotation rate of 1000 Hz.
Because the hotspot is placed in the center of the domain, the size of
the domain also becomes a constraint, and as a result, the evolution
time we can reach will become limited by the time it takes the burning
to approach the edge of the domain.  As a result, we focus here on the
early evolution.

Our 3D simulation used a base grid of $768^2 \times 192$ zones with 2
levels of refinement, the first jumping by a factor of 4 and the next
by a factor of 2.  The domain has a size $(1.96608\times
10^5~\mathrm{cm})^2 \times 2.4576\times 10^4~\mathrm{cm}$, giving a
fine grid resolution of $32~\mathrm{cm}$ laterally and
$16~\mathrm{cm}$ vertically.  The vertical resolution is finer to help
maintain hydrostatic equilibrium.  The initial model and other
simulation parameters are identical to those used in
\citet{harpole:2021}.  We used static mesh refinement, to achieve
better load balancing, fully refining the atmosphere below a height of
$3600~\mathrm{cm}$.  These simulations used the 7-isotope He-burning
network used in \citet{eiden:2020}.  The simulations were run on the
OLCF Summit supercomputer, on 342 to 1366 nodes, with 6 NVIDIA V100
GPUs per node.  The entire computation was offloaded to GPUs following
the strategy described in \citet{castro_gpu}.  Overall, about 250,000
node-hours were used for the calculation.  The full state of the
calculation was output only every 0.005 s, as each output file is 2.4 
TB in size (for single precision data).  We output a few fields more
frequently for visualization.  We ran a 2D simulation with the same
resolution and refinement strategy to compare with here.

Volume renderings

Because the 3D flame does not stay perfectly circular, it is difficult
to define the flame speed using the same method employed in
\citet{eiden:2020}.  Instead, we will look at the mass of the ash
material to assess how quickly the burning is taking place.
Figure~\ref{fig:mass_plot} shows the mass of the different species as
a function of time, for the 2D and 3D calculation.  The axisymmetric
2D calculation has slightly less volume than the 3D domain, since
rotating about the symmetry axis produces a cylindrical domain
inscribed in the 3D domain.  To compensate for this, we scale the
masses by the initial \isot{He}{4} mass.  This plot shows that the
masses of the heavy species , especially \isot{C}{12} and
\isot{Si}{28} grow quickly with time, but the 2D simulation appears to
burn faster than the 3D simulation.  This is because the assumption of
axisymmetry there does not allow for the complex structure we see in
the evolution of composition in the 3D flame.  This suggests that the
3D flame speed is slower than the 2D flame speed.

\section{Summary}

We have extended our simulation framework to three-dimensions, and
explored the differences between a two-dimensional axisymmetric
simulation and a fully three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation.

The main limitation of this study is that computational resources
limited the size of the domain and resolution we could use.  To
improve simulations for the future, there are several avenues to
pursue.  First, the main expense of the current simulations is the
reaction network.  We need to work more on optimization of the
network.  Second, while additional resolution will be expensive, we
can go higher order, as demonstrated with the 4th order accurate
coupling of hydro, diffusion, and reactions in \cite{castro-sdc}.  The
main outstanding issue with applying that work to the present problem
is the multilevel time integration.

Future work will explore mixed H/He bursts, using this same framework.
