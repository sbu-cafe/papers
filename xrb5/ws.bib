   abstract = {Astrophysical explosions such as supernovae are
                  fascinating events that require sophisticated
                  algorithms and substantial computational power to
                  model. Castro and MAESTROeX are nuclear astrophysics
                  codes that simulate thermonuclear fusion in the
                  context of supernovae and X-ray bursts. Examining
                  these nuclear burning processes using high
                  resolution simulations is critical for understanding
                  how these astrophysical explosions occur. In this
                  paper we describe the changes that have been made to
                  these codes to transform them from standard MPI +
                  OpenMP codes targeted at petascale CPU-based systems
                  into a form compatible with the pre-exascale systems
                  now online and the exascale systems coming soon. We
                  then discuss what new science is possible to run on
                  systems such as Summit and Perlmutter that could not
                  have been achieved on the previous generation of

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We perform a self-consistent calculation of the thermal structure in the crust of a superbursting neutron star. In particular, we follow the nucleosynthetic evolution of an accreted fluid element from its deposition into the atmosphere down to a depth where the electron Fermi energy is 20 MeV. We include temperature-dependent continuum electron capture rates and realistic sources of heat loss by thermal neutrino emission from the crust and core. We show that, in contrast to previous calculations, electron captures to excited states and subsequent Î³-emission significantly reduce the local heat loss due to weak-interaction neutrinos. Depending on the initial composition, these reactions release up to a factor of 10 times more heat at densities < 1011 g cm-3 than obtained previously. This heating reduces the ignition depth of superbursts. In particular, it reduces the discrepancy noted by Cumming et al. between the temperatures needed for unstable 12C ignition on timescales consistent with observations and the reduction in crust temperature from Cooper pair neutrino emission.}

	title = {Carbon Flashes in the Heavy-Element Ocean on Accreting Neutron Stars},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We show that the burning of a small mass fraction X12 of 12C in a neutron star ocean is thermally unstable at low accumulated masses when the ocean contains heavy ashes from the hydrogen-burning rapid proton process. The key to early unstable ignition is the decreased thermal conductivity of a heavy-element ocean. The instability requires accretion rates, , in excess of 1/10 the Eddington limit when X12 < 0.1. Lower 's will stably burn a small mass fraction of 12C. The unstable flashes release ~1042-1043 ergs over hours to days and are likely the cause of the recently discovered large type I bursts (the so-called superbursts) from six Galactic low-mass X-ray binaries. In addition to explaining the energetics, recurrence times, and durations of the superbursts, these mixed 12C flashes also have an dependence of unstable burning similar to that observed. Although the instability is present at accretion rates âEdd, the flashes provide less of a contrast with the accretion luminosity there, thus explaining why detection is easier when â (0.1-0.3)Edd.}

    abstract = { We summarize our current knowledge of neutron-star masses and radii. Recent instrumentation and computational advances have resulted in a rapid increase in the discovery rate and precise timing of radio pulsars in binaries in the past few years, leading to a large number of mass measurements. These discoveries show that the neutron-star mass distribution is much wider than previously thought, with three known pulsars now firmly in the 1.9â2.0-Mâ mass range. For radii, large, high-quality data sets from X-ray satellites as well as significant progress in theoretical modeling led to considerable progress in the measurements, placing them in the 10â11.5-km range and shrinking their uncertainties, owing to a better understanding of the sources of systematic errors. The combination of the massive-neutron-star discoveries, the tighter radius measurements, and improved laboratory constraints of the properties of dense matter has already made a substantial impact on our understanding of the composition and bulk properties of cold nuclear matter at densities higher than that of the atomic nucleus, a major unsolved problem in modern physics. }

	abstract = {We determine an empirical dense matter equation of state (EOS) from a heterogeneous data set of six neutron stars: three Type-I X-ray bursters with photospheric radius expansion, studied by Ãzel etÂ al., and three transient low-mass X-ray binaries. We critically assess the mass and radius determinations from the X-ray burst sources and show explicitly how systematic uncertainties, such as the photospheric radius at touchdown, affect the most probable masses and radii. We introduce a parameterized EOS and use a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm within a Bayesian framework to determine nuclear parameters such as the incompressibility and the density dependence of the bulk symmetry energy. Using this framework we show, for the first time, that these parameters, predicted solely on the basis of astrophysical observations, all lie in ranges expected from nuclear systematics and laboratory experiments. We find significant constraints on the massâradius relation for neutron stars, and hence on the pressureâdensity relation of dense matter. The predicted symmetry energy and the EOS near the saturation density are soft, resulting in relatively small neutron star radii around 11â12Â km for M = 1.4âMâ. The predicted EOS stiffens at higher densities, however, and our preferred model for X-ray bursts suggests that the neutron star maximum mass is relatively large, 1.9â2.2âMâ. Our results imply that several commonly used equations of state are inconsistent with observations.}

	abstract = {Multizone models of Type I X-ray bursts are presented that use an adaptive nuclear reaction network of unprecedented size, up to 1300 isotopes, for energy generation and include the most recent measurements and estimates of critical nuclear physics. Convection and radiation transport are included in calculations that carefully follow the changing composition in the accreted layer, both during the bursts themselves and in their ashes. Sequences of bursts, up to 15 in one case, are followed for two choices of accretion rate and metallicity, up to the point at which a limit cycle equilibrium is established. For = 1.75 Ã 10-9 Mâ yr-1 (and = 3.5 Ã 10-10 Mâ yr-1, for low metallicity), combined hydrogen-helium flashes occur. These bursts have light curves with slow rise times (seconds) and long tails. The rise times, shapes, and tails of these light curves are sensitive to the efficiency of nuclear burning at various waiting points along the rp-process path, and these sensitivities are explored. Each displays "compositional inertia" in that its properties are sensitive to the fact that accretion occurs onto the ashes of previous bursts that contain leftover hydrogen, helium, and CNO nuclei. This acts to reduce the sensitivity of burst properties to metallicity. Only the first anomalous burst in one model produces nuclei as heavy as A = 100. For the present choice of nuclear physics and accretion rates, other bursts and models make chiefly nuclei with A â 64. The amount of carbon remaining after hydrogen-helium bursts is typically â²1\% by mass and decreases further as the ashes are periodically heated by subsequent bursts. For = 3.5 Ã 10-10 Mâ yr-1 and solar metallicity, bursts are ignited in a hydrogen-free helium layer. At the base of this layer, up to 90\% of the helium has already burned to carbon prior to the unstable ignition of the helium shell. These helium-ignited bursts have (1) briefer, brighter light curves with shorter tails, (2) very rapid rise times (<0.1 s), and (3) ashes lighter than the iron group.}

However, bursts are also observed during episodes of transient accretion. During such events, the accretion rate can evolve significantly between bursts, and this regime provides a unique test for burst models. The accretion-powered millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 exhibits accretion outbursts every 2â3âyr. During the well-sampled month-long outburst of 2002 October, four helium-rich X-ray bursts were observed. Using this event as a test case, we present the first multizone simulations of X-ray bursts under a time-dependent accretion rate. We investigate the effect of using a time-dependent accretion rate in comparison to constant, averaged rates. Initial results suggest that using a constant, average accretion rate between bursts may underestimate the recurrence time when the accretion rate is decreasing, and overestimate it when the accretion rate is increasing. Our model, with an accreted hydrogen fraction of XÂ =Â 0.44 and a CNO metallicity of ZCNOÂ =Â 0.02, reproduces the observed burst arrival times and fluences with root mean square (rms) errors of 2.8âh, and \\$0.11\\times 10^\\{-6\\} \\mathrm\\{\\, erg \\mathrm\\{\\, cm^\\{-2\\}\\}\\}\\$, respectively.

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Type-I X-ray burst light curves encode unique information about the structure of accreting neutron stars and the nuclear reaction rates of the rp-process that powers bursts. Using the first model calculations of hydrogen/helium-burning bursts for a large range of astrophysical conditions performed with the code MESA, this work shows that simultaneous modelâobservation comparisons for bursts from several accretion rates are required to remove degeneracies in astrophysical conditions that otherwise reproduce bursts for a single and that such consistent multi-epoch modeling could possibly limit the 15O(Î±, Î³)19Ne reaction rate. Comparisons to the 1998, 2000, and 2007 bursting epochs of the neutron star GS 1826-24 show that must be larger than previously inferred and that the shallow heating in this source must be below 0.5Â MeV/u, providing a new method to constrain the shallow heating mechanism in the outer layers of accreting neutron stars. Features of the light curve rise are used to demonstrate that a lower limit could likely be placed on the 15O(Î±, Î³) reaction rate, demonstrating the possibility of constraining nuclear reaction rates with X-ray burst light curves.}

We find that the flame moves horizontally with velocities of the order of 105âcmâsâ1, crossing the ocean in a few seconds, broadly consistent with the rise times of Type I X-ray bursts. We address the open question of what drives flame propagation, and find that heat is transported from burning to unburnt fuel by a combination of top-to-bottom conduction and mixing driven by a baroclinic instability. The speed of the flame propagation is therefore a sensitive function of the ocean conductivity and spin: we explore this dependence for an astrophysically relevant range of parameters and find that in general flame propagation is faster for slower rotation and higher conductivity.}",

    abstract = "{Type I X-ray bursts are produced by thermonuclear runaways that develop on accreting neutron stars. Once one location ignites, the flame propagates across the surface of the star. Flame propagation is fundamental in order to understand burst properties like rise time and burst oscillations. Previous work quantified the effects of rotation on the front, showing that the flame propagates as a deflagration and that the front strongly resembles a hurricane. However, the effect of magnetic fields was not investigated, despite the fact that magnetic fields strong enough to have an effect on the propagating flame are expected to be present on many bursters. In this paper, we show how the coupling between fluid layers introduced by an initially vertical magnetic field plays a decisive role in determining the character of the fronts that are responsible for the type I bursts. In particular, on a star spinning at 450Â Hz (typical among the bursters), we test seed magnetic fields of 107â1010Â G and find that for the medium fields the magnetic stresses that develop during the burst can speed up the velocity of the burning front, bringing the simulated burst rise time close to the observed values. By contrast, in a magnetic slow rotator like IGR J17480â2446, spinning at 11Â Hz, a seed field â³109Â G is required to allow localized ignition and the magnetic field plays an integral role in generating the burst oscillations observed during the bursts.}",

In this paper, we study the effects of rotation on propagation in the meridional (latitudinal) direction, where the Coriolis force changes from its maximum at the poles to zero at the equator.

We also observe structural differences between the flame propagating towards the equator and that propagating towards the pole, the second being faster.

The unperturbed front is characterized by the balance between the pressure gradient and the Coriolis force of a spinning neutron star (Î½Â =Â 450 Hz in our case). This balance leads to a fast horizontal velocity field parallel to the flame front. This flow is strongly sheared in the vertical direction. When we perturb the front an instability quickly corrugates the front. We identify this instability as the baroclinic instability. Most importantly, the flame is not disrupted by the instability and there are two major consequences: the overall flame propagation speed is â¼10 times faster than in the unperturbed case and distinct flame vortices appear. The speedup is due to the corrugation of the front and the dynamics of the vortices. These vortices may also be linked to the oscillations observed in the light curves of the bursts.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We analyze the global hydrodynamic flow in the ocean of an accreting, rapidly rotating, nonmagnetic neutron star in a low-mass X-ray binary during a type I X-ray burst. We use both analytical arguments and numerical simulations of simplified models for ocean burning. Our analysis extends previous work by taking into account the rapid rotation of the star and the lift-up of the burning ocean during the burst. We find a new regime for the spreading of a nuclear burning front, where the flame is carried along a coherent shear flow across the front. If turbulent viscosity is weak, the speed of flame propagation is vflame ~ (gh)1/2/ftn ~ 20 km s-1, where h is the scale height of the burning ocean, g is the local gravitational acceleration, tn is the timescale for fast nuclear burning during the burst, and f is the Coriolis parameter, i.e., twice the local vertical component of the spin vector. If turbulent viscosity is dynamically important, the flame speed increases and reaches the maximum value, v ~ (gh/ftn)1/2 ~ 300 km s-1, when the eddy overturn frequency is comparable to the Coriolis parameter f. We show that, as a result of rotationally reduced gravity, the thermonuclear runaway which ignites the ocean is likely to begin on the equator. The equatorial belt is ignited at the beginning of the burst, and the flame then propagates from the equator to the poles. Inhomogeneous cooling (equator first, poles second) of the hot ashes drives strong zonal currents which may be unstable to the formation of Jupiter-type vortices; we conjecture that these vortices are responsible for coherent modulation of X-ray flux in the tails of some bursts. We consider the effect of strong zonal currents on the frequency of modulation of the X-ray flux and show that the large values of the frequency drifts observed in some bursts can be accounted for within our model combined with the model of homogeneous radial expansion. Additionally, if vortices or other inhomogeneities are trapped in the forward zonal flows around the propagating burning front, fast chirps with large frequency ranges (~25-500 Hz) may be detectable during the burst rise. Finally, we argue that an MHD dynamo within the burning front can generate a small-scale magnetic field, which may enforce vertically rigid flow in the front's wake and can explain the coherence of oscillations in the burst tail.}

	abstract = {Burst oscillations during the rising phases of thermonuclear X-ray bursts are usually believed to originate from flame spreading on the neutron star surface. However, the decrease of fractional oscillation amplitude with rise time, which provides a main observational support for the flame spreading model, have so far been reported from only a few bursts. Moreover, the non-detection and intermittent detections of rise oscillations from many bursts are not yet understood considering the flame spreading scenario. Here, we report the decreasing trend of fractional oscillation amplitude from an extensive analysis of a large sample of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Proportional Counter Array bursts from 10 neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. This trend is 99.99\% significant for the best case, which provides, to the best of our knowledge, by far the strongest evidence of such a trend. Moreover, it is important to note that an opposite trend is not found in any of the bursts. The concave shape of the fractional amplitude profiles for all the bursts suggests latitude-dependent flame speeds, possibly due to the effects of the Coriolis force. We also systematically study the roles of low fractional amplitude and low count rate for non-detection and intermittent detections of rise oscillations, and attempt to understand them within the flame spreading scenario. Our results support a weak turbulent viscosity for flame spreading, and imply that burst rise oscillations originate from an expanding hot spot, thus making these oscillations a more reliable tool to constrain the neutron star equations of state.}

Where IGR J17511â3057 is unusual compared to the other two persistent pulsars is that oscillations are not detected throughout all bursts. As accretion rate drops the bursts get brighter and their rise/decay time-scales become shorter, while the oscillation amplitude falls below the detection threshold: first in the burst peak and then also in the rise. None of the bursts from IGR J17511â3057 shows evidence for photospheric radius expansion (which might be expected to suppress oscillation amplitude) which allow us to set an upper limit to the distance of 6.9 kpc.

abstract = {We present a class of second-order conservative finite difference algorithms for solving numerically time-dependent problems for hyperbolic conservation laws in several space variables. These methods are upwind and multidimensional, in that the numerical fluxes are obtained by solving the characteristic form of the full multidimensional equations at the zone edge, and that all fluxes are evaluated and differenced at the same time; in particular, operator splitting is not used. Correct behavior at discontinuities is obtained by the use of solutions to the Riemann problem, and by limiting some of the second-order terms. Numerical results are presented, which show that the methods described here yield the same high resolution as the corresponding operator split methods.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We present detailed models of low- and intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with and without the 18F(Î±,p)21Ne reaction included in the nuclear network, where the rate for this reaction has been recently experimentally evaluated for the first time. The lower and recommended measured rates for this reaction produce negligible changes to the stellar yields, whereas the upper limit of the rate affects the production of 19F and 21Ne. The stellar yields increase by ~50\% to up to a factor of 4.5 for 19F, and by factors of ~2 to 9.6 for 21Ne. While the 18F(Î±,p)21Ne reaction competes with 18O production, the extra protons released are captured by 18O to facilitate the 18O(p,Î±)15N(Î±,Î³)19F chain. The higher abundances of 19F obtained using the upper limit of the rate helps to match the [F/O] ratios observed in AGB stars, but only for large C/O ratios. Extramixing processes are proposed to help to solve this problem. Some evidence that the 18F(Î±,p)21Ne rate might be closer to its upper limit is provided by the fact that the higher calculated 21Ne/22Ne ratios in the He intershell provide an explanation for the Ne isotopic composition of silicon-carbide grains from AGB stars. This needs to be confirmed by future experiments of the 18F(Î±,p)21Ne reaction rate. The availability of accurate fluorine yields from AGB stars will be fundamental for interpreting observations of this element in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars.}

abstract = {Reacting astrophysical flows can be challenging to model, because of the difficulty in accurately coupling hydrodynamics and reactions. This can be particularly acute during explosive burning or at high temperatures where nuclear statistical equilibrium is established. We develop a new approach, based on the ideas of spectral deferred corrections (SDC) coupling of explicit hydrodynamics and stiff reaction sources as an alternative to operator splitting, that is simpler than the more comprehensive SDC approach we demonstrated previously. We apply the new method to a double-detonation problem with a moderately sized astrophysical nuclear reaction network and explore the time step size and reaction network tolerances, to show that the simplified-SDC approach provides improved coupling with decreased computational expense compared to traditional Strang operator splitting. This is all done in the framework of the Castro hydrodynamics code, and all algorithm implementations are freely available.}

Taking into consideration the power in the oscillations and the number of trials in the search, the detection is significant at the 99.96\% confidence level. If the oscillations are confirmed, the oscillation frequency would suggest that XTE J1739-285 contains the fastest rotating neutron star yet found. We also found millisecond quasi-periodic oscillations in the persistent emission with frequencies ranging from 757 to 862 Hz. Using the brightest burst, we derive an upper limit on the source distance of about 10.6 kpc.}

The spectral evolution of the burst indicates photospheric-radius expansion and contraction. The 524 Hz signal occurred at the end of the contraction phase, lasted for ~2 s, was highly coherent (Q â³ 900), and had a pulse fraction (ratio of sinusoidal amplitude to mean count rate) of 6.2\% Â± 0.6\%. KS 1731-260 is one of only three systems that have exhibited high-coherence millisecond oscillations during X-ray bursts and the first reported in which the pulsations are associated with photospheric contraction. These coherent signals may be interpreted as a direct indication of the neutron star spin.}

Furthermore, p-nuclei up to 126Xe are found to be produced after the flash, thanks to our large network. The postprocess nucleosynthesis for accretion rates of 3 Ã 10-10, 3 Ã 10-9, and 10-8 Mâ yr-1, which corresponds to an ignition pressure from 1022.7 to 1022.9 dyn cm-2, reveals that H is exhausted completely during the burst. This is because H decreases significantly as a result of the steady burning before the burst and convective mixing at the initial stage; we find that 64Zn is the most abundant element after the burst.}

journal = {Research Notes of the AAS},
abstract = {Many astrophysical environments involve convective or explosive flows driven by thermonuclear reactions (Type Ia supernovae, classical novae, X-ray bursts, stellar evolution). Simulation codes need to accurately capture the interactions between reactions and hydrodynamics to produce realistic models of these events. For astrophysical reacting flows, operator splitting is commonly used to couple hydrodynamics and reactions. Each process operates independent of one another, but by staggering the updates in a symmetric fashion (via Strang splitting) second order accuracy in time can be achieved. However, approximations are often made to the reacting system, including the choice of whether or not to integrate temperature with the species. Here we demonstrate through a simple convergence test that integrating an energy equation together with reactions achieves the best convergence when modeling reactive flows with Strang splitting. Additionally, second order convergence cannot be achieved without integrating an energy or temperature equation.}
